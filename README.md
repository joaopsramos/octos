## Implementation details

- I thought it would be better to run the seed only in the dev environment.
Running it in the test environment would make it harder to test the records being seeded.
Since it currently runs only in the dev environment, it would make more sense for it to be a Mix task.
- I ended up using two libraries that validate parameters (Goal and Flop). The reason for this is that
I find the format used by Flop a bit awkward to expose directly through the API. Additionally,
I didnâ€™t want to be tied to the format of a specific library, considering it might be replaced in the future.
As a result, Goal is used to validate the parameters, while Flop handles filtering and sorting.
